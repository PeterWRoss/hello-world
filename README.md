# hello-world
newbie
Hey people, 
I am completely green at coding. I was always fascinated by computers, software, the internet and how how it works. Unfortunately, I was always intimidated by all the different words and symbols. I am going through a transition stage right now. One of my friends reminded me of his story: he was 22, about to have a kid, and was in college in his senior year (majoring in philosophy). He came to realize that his major was not going to get the bills paid. So, he locked himself into a room for about 6 weeks, and after that he was knew the basics. A few weeks later, he goes out on a job interview and got a salary job at 70k. 
His story was inspiring... He told me, "It is not hard as you think it is. If you have the will power and discipline to learn it, you will learn it. It is like learning how to speak in a different language." 

I hung up the phone with him and ran to me computer and started studying html5 and CSS. After a couple of hours, a lot of those codes and tags that I would see in the websites when I would accidently inspect an element started to make more sense. I know HTML5 and CSS are like playing with legos. But, it felt good knowing that this stuff is actually learnable -- and you don't necesasrily have to be a rocket scientist. 

Any assistance, guidance, support any of you are willing to give me, I thank you in advance!
